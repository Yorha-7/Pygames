# objective of this repo
I thought of using simulators before. gazebo was good, never got a chance to use isaac_sim ( i cant even set it up)
and just say this cool youtube channel known as green code. so if he is using green code like that then i should give it a try too.
first i will complete the basic to make a enivornment 
then i will try implementaing pid first, maybe i could make a tuner for the pid letting the user to visualize it.
its just the idea but i will work on it soon.
